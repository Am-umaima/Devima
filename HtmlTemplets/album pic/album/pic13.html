			Tucked away in the Alps, Switzerland is easily one of the most beautiful countries
			in the world, no matter when you're visiting. Come wintertime though, it becomes a 
			veritable wonderland, with powdery ski slopes and frozen lakes galore. For the best 
			vantage point of the country's natural beauty, stay in the village of Zermatt, a ski
			town so pristine that people actually buy bottles of air from the surrounding mountains 
			(including Switzerlandâ€™s iconic Matterhorn mountain). Not a fan of skiing? A summer visit
			to Switzerland is always a good idea, where Lake Geneva's picturesque banks and Zurich's
			badi (natural swimming pools along the lakes and rivers) are waiting to host your next family vacation.
