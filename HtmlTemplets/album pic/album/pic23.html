			Norway is the land of glaciers, mountains, the Northern Lights, and fjords—so many fjords.
			The UNESCO-listed Geirangerfjord and Nærøyfjord in southwestern Norway are among the most 
			scenic anywhere, with steep rock walls and dense forests. For something a little more unique
			(and daring), there's Trolltunga at Hardangerfjord. This protruding rock sits about 2,300 feet
			above Lake Ringedalsvatnet and provides some of the most spectacular panoramic views in the country.
			And don't forget about the Lofoten Islands, sitting pretty off the country's northwestern coast.
