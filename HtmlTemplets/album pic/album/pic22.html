		<p>
			Located in Kenya's Rift Valley, Lake Nakuru is known for attracting lions,
			leopards, and swarms of feeding flamingos. Although rising water levels over
			the past few years have caused the number of pink birds to drop, the protected
			area is still a sight to behold, due to the diversity of wildlife it attracts.
