			There are more than 7,000 islands in the Philippines, and they easily number among the most beautiful in the world 
			(in fact, Siargao is our readers' number one pick). The Puerto-Princesa Subterranean River National Park in Palawan
			encompasses mangrove forests, one of the worldâ€™s most impressive cave systems, and an underground river. The Chocolate
			Hills of Bohol Island consist of an estimated 1,776 grass-covered domes that are mysteriously uniform in shape. The rice
			terraces of both Banaue and the Philippine Cordilleras provide panoramic views of every shade of green imaginable.
