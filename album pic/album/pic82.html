			Located in the northern section of England's Lake District National Park,
			Derwentwater is surrounded by verdant hills and hiking trails. Make the charming
			town of Keswick your base, where you'll quickly see why this region of England 
			inspired poets like William Wordsworth, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, and Robert Southey.
