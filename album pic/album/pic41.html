			As crowded as Ubud can get, the town is only minutes from dozens of authentic
			villages and peaceful countryside vistas. Rent a motorbike or bicycle at your 
			hotel and get lost in the villages, tangerine groves, and rice paddiesâ€”kept alive
			by farmers who tend the terraces just as previous generations have done for millennia.
