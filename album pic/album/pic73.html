			The poet Lord Byron once called Montenegro’s Adriatic coastline “the most beautiful encounter between 
			land and sea”—and we tend to agree. The entire country has a population roughly the size of Stockholm's,
			but it more than makes up for its small size in unadulterated stretches of sand, surf, and green spaces. 
			The curving Bay of Kotor is a mash-up of Lake Como and Norway's fjords, and is dotted with ancient Turkish
			and Greek settlements and UNESCO World Heritage sites. Further inland, Biogradska Gora National Park is home 
			to one of Europe's three remaining virgin forests, which have mature ecosystems as a result of being more or 
			less untouched by man. Visit now, before everyone else starts to catch on.
