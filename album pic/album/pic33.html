			You'll be hard-pressed to find a Caribbean island with as much action as the Dominican Republic,
			thanks in large part to the country's expansive list of must-visit beaches and jungles. On the Samaná peninsula
			, the aptly-named Playa Bonita has crystal-clear waters ideal for snorkeling and diving—and plenty of palm trees 
			for your classic tropical 'gram. If you prefer green to blue, head to Los Haitises National Park on the island's 
			northeast coast. With its unique limestone rock formations and mangrove forests, the park is easily one of the most
			beautiful places in the Dominican Republic—and perhaps even the entire Caribbean.
