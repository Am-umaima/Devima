			With its gentle coastlines and transporting sunsets, it's easy to see why Boracay was 
			voted one of the best islands in the world by our readers. Unfortunately, it's become too 
			touristedâ€”the island closed for "rehabilitation" last year to compensate for overcrowding 
			and unregulated development; it's since reopened to a limited number of visitors per day.
