			A short, four-hour flight from Johannesburg (South African Airways offers daily, nonstop flights),
			Mauritius is one of the most beautiful and accessible tropical islands off the east coast of Africa.
			Instagram and Pinterest have created renewed interest in the country, thanks to its “underwater waterfall”—a
			visually stunning runoff of sand and silt best viewed from above. Add to that some turquoise lagoons and seas
			rich with marine life, and it's easy to see why our readers voted Mauritius one of the absolute best islands 
			in the entire world.
