			Poised between the Balkans and central Europe, Croatia is a land of limestone caves,
			undulating fields, and white pebble beaches. The country's most famous waters are found inland at
			the Plitvice Lakes National Park, a system of waterfalls, caves, and 16 terraced lakes that cover
			the entire blue-green color spectrum. The Adriatic Sea coast is truly unrivaled, speckled with more than 
			1,000 islands surrounded by impossibly clear water. The Dinaric Alps provide even more sublime views and help
			contribute to Croatia's overall landscapeâ€”the craggy peaks and caverns near the coast transition to rolling farmland
			in the northeast Hrvatsko Zagorje region.
